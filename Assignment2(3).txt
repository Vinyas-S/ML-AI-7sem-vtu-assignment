The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms.
The approach is very simple and flexible, and can be used in a myriad of ways for extracting features from documents.
A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:

1)A vocabulary of known words.
2)A measure of the presence of known words.

Let’s take an example to understand this concept in depth.

“It was the best of times”
“It was the worst of times”
“It was the age of wisdom”
“It was the age of foolishness”

We treat each sentence as a separate document and we make a list of all words from all the four documents excluding the punctuation. We get,

‘It’, ‘was’, ‘the’, ‘best’, ‘of’, ‘times’, ‘worst’, ‘age’, ‘wisdom’, ‘foolishness’

The next step is the create vectors. Vectors convert text that can be used by the machine learning algorithm.

We take the first document — “It was the best of times” and we check the frequency of words from the 10 unique words.
“it” = 1
“was” = 1
“the” = 1
“best” = 1
“of” = 1
“times” = 1
“worst” = 0
“age” = 0
“wisdom” = 0
“foolishness” = 0
Rest of the documents will be:
“It was the best of times” = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
“It was the worst of times” = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
“It was the age of wisdom” = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
“It was the age of foolishness” = [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]
