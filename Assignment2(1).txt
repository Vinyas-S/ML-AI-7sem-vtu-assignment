Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word.
Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers. A stemming algorithm reduces the words
 “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem “retrieve”
 Stemming is an important part of the pipelining process in Natural language processing. The input to the stemmer is tokenized words. 
 Some more example of stemming for root word "like" include:
->"likes"
->"liked"
->"likely"
->"liking"
